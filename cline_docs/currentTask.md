## Current Task: Prepare for Vercel Deployment

### Objectives
- Summarize the state of the project after fixes.
- Outline steps for deployment and testing on Vercel.

### Context
- Critical configuration, security, and compatibility fixes have been applied.
- The project now builds successfully (`npm run build`), although linting shows numerous non-blocking errors (mostly unused code).
- The `/api/analyze` and `/api/transcribe` routes enqueue jobs but require a background worker and storage implementation to be functional.
- The application is now ready for initial deployment to Vercel for testing the core UI and working API routes (`/synthesize`, `/analyze-transcription`, `/job-status`, `/jobs`, `/reports`).

### Identified Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
*(Note: AI keys should ideally not have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix if only used server-side)*

### Next Steps
1.  Commit the recent changes to version control.
2.  Deploy the project to a Vercel preview environment.
3.  Configure the required environment variables in the Vercel project settings:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    - `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4.  Test the deployed application, focusing on UI, navigation, and the working API routes. Note that analysis and transcription submission will create jobs but won't complete.
5.  (Future) Plan and implement the background worker and file storage.
6.  (Future) Address ESLint errors.
