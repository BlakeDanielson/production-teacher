## Project Roadmap

### High-Level Goals
- [ ] Prepare the application for successful deployment on Vercel.
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are compatible and configurations are optimized for Vercel.
- [ ] Identify and document required environment variables for deployment.

### Key Features (Existing)
*(To be filled in after codebase review)*

### Vercel Deployment Readiness Criteria
- [x] Core configurations (`package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`) reviewed.
- [x] API routes checked for serverless compatibility and environment variable usage.
- [x] Dependencies verified for compatibility.
- [x] Required environment variables identified and documented.
- [x] **Fixes Required:**
    - [x] Resolve PostCSS configuration conflict (`.js` vs `.mjs`) - Deleted `.mjs`.
    - [x] Align Mantine versions (`@mantine/core` vs `@mantine/next`) - Verified existing versions are correct.
    - [x] Fix API Key security vulnerability in `/api/analyze` and `/api/transcribe`.
    - [x] Remove `yt-dlp` dependency from `/api/analyze` (replace with alternative). - *Code removed, replacement needed.*
    - [x] Remove unused `ffmpeg` code from `/api/transcribe`.
    - [x] Refactor long-running API calls (`/analyze`, `/transcribe`) to use job queue. - *Routes modified to enqueue jobs, worker implementation needed.*
    - [ ] (Optional) Refactor `/synthesize` and `/analyze-transcription` to use job queue for timeout prevention.
- [x] Build process confirmed to work correctly after fixes. - *Build succeeds, linting fails (non-blocking).*
- [ ] Test application thoroughly on Vercel preview deployment.
- [ ] (Optional) Address ESLint errors for code quality.

### Progress Tracker
- [x] Initial documentation setup.
- [x] Project review for Vercel deployment completed.
- [x] Configuration fixes implemented.
- [x] API route fixes implemented (Security, Compatibility, Job Queue Enqueuing done for /analyze & /transcribe).
- [x] Build check completed.
- [ ] Vercel deployment testing completed.

### Completed Tasks
- Initial documentation setup (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`).
- Reviewed core configuration files (`package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`).
- Reviewed API routes (`/synthesize`, `/analyze`, `/analyze-transcription`, `/job-status`, `/jobs`, `/reports`, `/transcribe`).
- Verified dependencies and identified compatibility issues (Mantine, PostCSS).
- Identified required environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
