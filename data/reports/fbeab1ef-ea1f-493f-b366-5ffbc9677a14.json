The tutorial covers vocoders, FFT morphs, resonators, convolvers, match EQs, and pitch shifters. Au5 demonstrates the application of each technique to various bass sounds, highlighting their unique character and how they can be used to create diverse sonic textures.\n\n## Key Production Tips\n*   Use vocoders with a sidechain input to modulate the frequency response of your bass sound.\n*   Experiment with different band counts and attack/release settings in vocoders for varying levels of tonal detail.\n*   For cleaner colorization than vocoders, try FFT morphs for clearer results and no phase shifting artifacts.\n*   Use resonators with MIDI input to avoid the need for an audio sidechain.\n*   Convolvers can add tonal color and texture using impulse responses.\n*   Match EQs can capture the frequency response of one sound and apply it to another, a technique Au5 discovered while working on his song \"Atlantis\".\n*   FFT tuners can polyphonically auto-tune various frequencies to the closest note in a chosen scale.\n\n## Techniques Demonstrated/Discussed\n*   **Vocoding:** Sidechaining a modulator (like a chord) to a vocoder to colorize a bass sound. This technique allows producers to imprint the frequency characteristics of the modulator onto the bass, creating a distinctive \"talking\" effect.\n*   **FFT Morphing:** Using FFT-based plugins like Melda MMorph to blend two sounds based on their frequency spectrums. This provides a cleaner alternative to vocoding, avoiding potential phase-shifting artifacts.\n*   **Resonators:** Using resonators like Ableton Spectral Resonator, Reaktor Prism or Zynth Audio Resonator to add tonal color by resonating specific frequencies based on MIDI input. This avoids the need for a sidechain input.\n*   **Convolution:** Using convolvers like Hybrid Reverb or Kilohearts Convolver to apply an impulse response (a short audio file) to the bass sound. The impulse response acts as a filter, shaping the frequency content of the bass.\n*   **Match EQ:** Capturing the frequency response of one sound (e.g., a chord) using a Match EQ, and then applying that EQ curve to another sound (e.g., a bass). This technique allows you to transfer the tonal qualities of one instrument to another.\n*   **Pitch Shifting:** Using FFT tuners like Zynaptiq PITCHMAP or reTune to pitch-quantize different frequencies of a bass sound to the nearest note in a specified scale. This can create polyphonic auto-tuning effects and unique harmonic or dissonant sounds.\n\n## Tools & Software Mentioned\n*   Ableton Live (DAW)\n*   Ableton Stock Vocoder\n*   Melda MVocoder\n*   Image-Line Vocodex\n*   FFT Vocoder (Max for Live Device)\n*   Melda MMorph\n*   Zynaptiq MORPH\n*   Ableton Spectral Resonator\n*   Reaktor Effects Prism\n*   Zynth Audio Resonator\n*   Hybrid Reverb\n*   Kilohearts Convolver\n*   M Cabinet\n*   Ozone 10 Match EQ\n*   Melda MFreeformEqualizer\n*   reTune\n*   Zynaptiq PITCHMAP\n\n## Actionable Advice\n*   Experiment with different coloring techniques to find what best suits your specific sound and style.\n*   Consider the trade-off between processing power and latency when choosing between vocoders and FFT morphs.\n*   Don't be afraid to experiment and stumble upon new techniques, like Au5 did with the Match EQ method.\n\nLet me know if there is anything else you would like to know.",
